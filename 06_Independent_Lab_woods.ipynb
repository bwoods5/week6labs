    "One thing I struggled with a little in this assignment was in the adding violations portion. While testing out my code, I tried adding multiple violations to one student and it would override the previous violation and only display the most recent entry. My thought to fix this would be to create a new list for second and third violations for example, but I was curious if there would be a more efficient way to store this information; for example maybe a list inside of a list in this case? I tried not to get hung up on this as it wasn't a requirement for the assignment but from a data perspective it seens like a silly reason to lose data."
